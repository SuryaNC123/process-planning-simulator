# 🖥️ Process Planning Simulator

<p align="center">
A browser-based CPU Process Scheduling Simulator developed to demonstrate <br>
how different scheduling algorithms manage process execution in an operating <br>
system environment. The simulator allows users to input multiple processes <br>
with Arrival Time, Burst Time, and Priority values for realistic testing. <br>
Interactive Gantt charts with Waiting and Turnaround metrics make learning easier.
