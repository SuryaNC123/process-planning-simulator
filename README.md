# 🖥️ Process Planning Simulator

A browser-based CPU Process Scheduling Simulator designed to demonstrate and visualize how different scheduling algorithms manage process execution in an operating system.  
The simulator allows users to input multiple processes with Arrival Time, Burst Time, and Priority values.  
It supports popular algorithms like FCFS, SJF, Priority Scheduling, and Round Robin for performance comparison.  
Interactive Gantt charts and computed metrics such as Waiting Time and Turnaround Time help in clear understanding.  
This project serves as an educational tool for learning Operating System concepts through real-time simulation.
