I am building a CPU Process Scheduling Simulator as a BTech Operating Systems project.

IMPORTANT:
Use ONLY the following languages and tools.
Do NOT use anything else.

-----------------------------------
ALLOWED LANGUAGES & TOOLS
-----------------------------------
- HTML (for structure and UI)
- CSS (for styling only)
- Vanilla JavaScript (plain JavaScript only)
- Browser-based execution only

-----------------------------------
NOT ALLOWED (STRICT)
-----------------------------------
- React
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- Backend servers
- Databases
- Frameworks or libraries
- External APIs
- OS or hardware interaction

-----------------------------------
PROJECT CONTEXT
-----------------------------------
This is a SOFTWARE-ONLY simulation project.
It logically simulates CPU scheduling behavior.
It does NOT interact with real CPU or hardware.

The simulator is already partially implemented and working.
DO NOT rewrite everything.
ONLY extend and modify incrementally.

-----------------------------------
CURRENT FEATURES ALREADY WORKING
-----------------------------------
- Add Process form
- Process Queue table
- Algorithm selection
- Gantt chart visualization
- Detailed results (CT, TAT, WT, RT)
- Execution logs
- Summary metrics

-----------------------------------
NEW MODIFICATIONS REQUIRED
-----------------------------------

Apply the following changes carefully WITHOUT breaking existing functionality.

==============================
CHANGE 1 — Number of Processes Input
==============================
In the Add Process section:

Add a new input at the top:
- "Number of Processes"

Behavior:
- User enters total number of processes
- Limit/validate additions based on this number
- Then user fills:
  PID, Arrival Time, Burst Time, Priority

==============================
CHANGE 2 — Table Alignment Fix
==============================
Fix UI alignment issue:
- PID, Arrival Time, Burst Time are aligned
- Priority column is slightly shifted

Make Priority perfectly aligned in the same horizontal row.
Use CSS only.

==============================
CHANGE 3 — Execution Logs Toggle
==============================
Move Execution Logs section:

Placement:
Immediately AFTER the Gantt Chart

Behavior:
- Hidden by default
- Add small button: "Show Execution Logs"
- Clicking toggles show/hide

Goal:
Keep UI clean and uncluttered

==============================
CHANGE 4 — Section Order Restructure
==============================
Reorder layout as:

1. Add Processes
2. Process Queue
3. Algorithm Selection
4. Run Simulation
5. Gantt Chart
6. Execution Logs (toggle)
7. Detailed Results Table
8. Summary Dashboard (at very bottom)

Move summary metrics to the END:
- Avg Turnaround Time
- Avg Waiting Time
- CPU Utilization
- Context Switches
- Total Idle Time

==============================
CHANGE 5 — Algorithm Selector Position
==============================
Move algorithm selection BELOW the Process Queue.

Flow should be:

Input Processes → Queue → Choose Algorithm → Run

NOT algorithm first.

-----------------------------------
IMPLEMENTATION RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)
-----------------------------------
- Do NOT rewrite entire project
- Extend existing files only
- Keep beginner-friendly code
- Add comments
- Implement step-by-step
- Maintain current functionality
- Do not introduce any frameworks
- Use only Vanilla JavaScript DOM manipulation

-----------------------------------
HOW TO PROCEED
-----------------------------------
1. Identify existing structure
2. Apply changes incrementally
3. Test after each change
4. Keep UI clean and simple
